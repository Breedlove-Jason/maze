Summary

In 2021, I began my journey to becoming a self-taught software developer. This maze game is focused on enhancing more advanced skills in javascript. It uses and algorithm to build its walls; each time creating a different maze for the user to play. It utilizes the matter-js library to create a canvas, player ball, and end goal.

I currently have experience in Javascript, HTML, CSS, REACT, Java and Python. However, I decided to change my path to becoming a full stack developer and this was one of my earlier projects.
